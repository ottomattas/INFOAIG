Task 1a
* We used sessions from X to Y in the dstc2_traindev dataset to model the transition diagram.
* Python code was created bbased on the task description.

Deliverables
The zip file holds both the transition diagram and the python program.
We delivered Team18_1a_1.zip with successful results, while Team18_1a_2.zip is improved after feedback was received. Team18_1a_2.zip was not delivered for review as this was done during the practice session locally on 17/09/2019.


Task 1b
* We used the dstc2_traindev dataset to create the baselines.
* Python code was created bbased on the task description.

Baseline creation
1) We parsed all the acts and created files with the output to describe the turns in appropriately named files (e.g "1b/baseline_data/ack").
2) After we had the turns separated, we parsed all the transcriptions for creating the ruleset for every act (e.g "1b/baseline_data/ack.t").
3) We created the baseline rules manually in "1b/baseline_rules".
